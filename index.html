                  <p>Ada Lovelace was born Augusta Ada Byron in London on December 10, 1815, to the famous poet Lord Byron, and his wife Anne Isabella Milbanke.
                    She was separated from her father after birth, who later died when she was eight. She did not have a close relationship with her mother either and was looked after by her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke</p>
                  <p>Fearing Ada would inherit her father’s poetic temperament, Lady Byron gave her a strict upbringing. From the age of 4, Lovelace was tutored in mathematics and science, an unusual course of study for a woman in 19th-century England.</p>
                  <p>She was often ill in her childhood. An outbreak of measles even left her paralyzed. It took her a few years to be able to walk again with crutches. Ada never allowed the illnesses to put a stop to her learning. She continued to develop her mathematical and technological skills.</p>
                  <p>By the age of 12, Ada had grown fascinated with mechanical engineering. She conceptualized her very own flying machine. She went on to write a book titled Flyology, in which she illustrated, with her very own diagrams, her own plans and diagrams to build a winged flying apparatus.</p>
                  <p>Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, which she used to further her education.
                    Ada described her approach as "poetical science" and herself as an "Analyst & Metaphysician".</p>
                  <p>Ada Lovelace died in London at the age of 36 from uterine cancer, on 27 November 1852. She was buried next to her father at her request, at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.</p>

                  <p class="">In June 1833, at the age of 17, Ada met the famous mathematician and ‘Father of the Computer’ Charles Babbage.
                    She was introduced to him by their mutual friend and her private tutor, Mary Somerville, another female scientist and mathematician famous in her day.
                    When Babbage showed Ada the prototype for his Difference Engine, she became fascinated with the machine. Babbage was also impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills.
                    They ended up working together for many years on Babbage’s brainchild, the “Analytical Engine”.</p>
                  <p>It was during this collaboration that Lovelace translated an article by Italian mathematician Luigi Federico Menabrea on Babbage's engine.
                    She added her own notes to the translation in which she described a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers with the Engine.
                    This method is what some consider as the first algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine and thus the first computer program, making her the world's first computer programmer.</p>
                  <p>Babbage was hugely impressed with Lovelace's contributions. He called her "The Enchantress of Numbers."</p>

                    It aims to increase the profile of women in STEM and, in doing so, create new role models who will encourage more girls into STEM careers and support women already working in STEM.</p>
